# Community Bytes 2.0
Community bytes was a project I created during my time in General Assembly's software immersive program. In the time since, I have deepened my knowledge of React and Express. So this project is meant to reflect my increased knowledge. Additionally, I am using this project to learn other things including SASS, Docker, AWS, Unit/Integration Testing, and SQL-based database. Additionally, this application will be my journey into building highly secure applications.

# What is community bytes?
